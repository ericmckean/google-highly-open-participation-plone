# Welcome to Plone's Project Page for the Google Highly Open Participation Contest #

# About Plone #

Plone is a user-friendly, highly evolved system for managing web pages online —also sometimes called a Content Management System, or CMS. Plone is particularly good at handling multiple languages, modeling organizational processes and integrating with existing systems.

It's easy to get started with Plone, and it installs on any desktop or laptop computer that runs Windows, Mac OS X or Linux.

Plone runs a wide range of large, high-profile sites, including the sites of [CIA](http://www.cia.gov) (yes, that CIA ;), [Novell](http://www.novell.com), [Trolltech](http://www.trolltech.com), [Amnesty International Switzerland](http://www.amnesty.ch), [Oxfam International](http://www.oxfam.org), [Discover Magazine](http://www.discovermagazine.com) and the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org). Many more can be found on the [Sites That Run Plone](http://plone.net/sites) page.

There are [over 200 Plone companies](http://plone.net/providers) around the world, and they are constantly looking for new talent. Participating in this contest is a great way to get noticed, and possibly land a fun and well-paid job at one of the existing Plone companies out there — or as a way to start your own!

For those of you who are into programming, Plone uses the Python programming language, as well as adhering to standards like XHTML and CSS on the front end.

Plone is owned by the Plone Foundation, a non-profit organization that Protects and Promotes Plone.
